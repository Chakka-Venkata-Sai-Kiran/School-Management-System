# College-Management-System
The goal of creating and implementing such a School management web 
application to properly manage and organise student records, to permit 
data and information flow across various activities linked to student 
information processing, and to safeguard student data.  
  
The current system makes use of an excel-based database. This is a system 
that is built on files. The greatest issue with this system is that there are 
more duplicate records owing to a lack of duplication control measures. 
The main key in a database management system is unique and capable of 
identifying any unique entry. As a result, it is a method of removing 
duplicates.
  
The present system is difficult to use because it lacks user-friendly APIs. 
It is possible to create an interactive GUI using scripting languages such 
as HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Such a graphical user interface aids the 
user in completing activities more quickly.
  
As a result, the proposed system will include the following:  
Front end: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap  
Back end: Oracle SQL  
Web Server: Tomcat Server  
Operating system: Windows 7 and above
